  # There is only one main list but 2 x 2 nuisance factors (keybindings) for a total of 64 subjects
  # (16 per nuisance list):
  # respKeyExp: 0 ['X':'word', 'M':'non-word'], 1 ['X':'non-word', 'M':'word']
  # respKeyTest: 0 ['X':'S', 'M':'SH'], 1 ['X':'SH', 'M':'S']
  #
  # Since 16 is above the cutoff for which MTurk charges 20% extra, we duplicate
  # each list and collect 8 participants for each of those duplicates.
