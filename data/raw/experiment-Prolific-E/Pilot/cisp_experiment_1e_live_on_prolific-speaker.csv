71,condition=H&label=S&respKeyExp=1&respKeyTest=1,i felt like the voice was dubbed over the video.,
70,condition=H&label=S&respKeyExp=1&respKeyTest=0,I definitely noticed the mannerisms as well as the fixation on the pen that she was holding spinning it and putting it in her mouth.  It seems as if she was speaking deliberately.  Also was fixated on trying to look at her mouth when she was speaking especially when trying to make out the s or sh sound,
74,condition=H&label=SH&respKeyExp=1&respKeyTest=0,No. They seemed like a regular person.,
73,condition=H&label=S&respKeyExp=0&respKeyTest=1,"She was very interested in twirling, playing with, and chewing on the pen, as if she was very bored.",
72,condition=H&label=SH&respKeyExp=0&respKeyTest=0,had a pen in her mouth sometimes ,
65,condition=H&label=S&respKeyExp=0&respKeyTest=0,"The speaker appears to have a lisp. There were some words spoken that were actual words, but due to the lisp sounded as if they were not ""real"" words. Some examples are when the speaker says the words ""legacy"", ""pregnancy"", ""peninsula"", and more. The word ""legacy"", for instance, is phonetically leh-gah-see but the speaker pronounces it as leh-gah-she with the H sound. The lisp makes it difficult to further distinguish between ASI and ASHI pronunciation. ",
66,condition=H&label=S&respKeyExp=0&respKeyTest=0,they kept eating the pen it was annoying ,
