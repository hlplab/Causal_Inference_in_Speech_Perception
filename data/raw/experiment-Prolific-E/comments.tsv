"1" "65" "" "The speaker appears to have a lisp. There were some words spoken that were actual words, but due to the lisp sounded as if they were not \"real\" words. Some examples are when the speaker says the words \"legacy\", \"pregnancy\", \"peninsula\", and more. The word \"legacy\", for instance, is phonetically leh-gah-see but the speaker pronounces it as leh-gah-she with the H sound. The lisp makes it difficult to further distinguish between ASI and ASHI pronunciation. "

"3" "70" "None" "I definitely noticed the mannerisms as well as the fixation on the pen that she was holding spinning it and putting it in her mouth.  It seems as if she was speaking deliberately.  Also was fixated on trying to look at her mouth when she was speaking especially when trying to make out the s or sh sound"

"20" "94" "Did you get the made-up words from Lord of the Rings? By the end, I watched the video for really just the dot. In some cases, the way the speaker was showing the pronunciation sometimes didn't match the audio. The pen in the mouth was really annoying too." "She had a pen in her mouth for many of the word pronunciations."
"21" "96" "Thank you." "The pen.  There were moments where she was speaking with the pen in her mouth, and it started to become intentional."
"22" "97" "" "She always was doing something with the pen she was holding, either biting on the end or twirling it. "
"23" "98" "Great study. Thank you." "I didn't notice anything odd. I did notice that the speaker frequently had a pen in her mouth while speaking."

"28" "108" "That was interesting and different. Thank you for letting me participate." "Sometimes it looked like she was saying ashi but it sounded like asi. Also, she kept putting that pen in her mouth which obscured some of her speech."
"29" "112" "This was interesting!" "It was odd that the speaker often had a pen in her mouth when she was speaking. I could hear \"ashi\" when I could see her mouth moving (without the pen in the way) but I hear \"asi\" when I couldn't see her mouth. Weird. "
"30" "113" "I almost never heard the SH sound during that task. I didn't just keep selecting the same key every time indiscriminately." "not particularly"
"31" "114" "I was trying to watch her mouth to see if I could tell the \"S\" from the \"SH\" but I guess that wouldn't help me if the sounds and the videos were mixed. " "I didn't notice anything except that sometimes she had a pen in her mouth. "
"32" "115" "none" "The pen: sometimes, sometime not, in mouth.  Also, in the second part there seemed to be different ways that she pronounced both terms (i.e. the \"s\" and \"sh\" sounds; sometimes they were clearly distinct and identifiable, sometimes they seemed to be unclear or somewhere between both).  Also, the video and the audio I suspect were not properly matched (in the second part), intentionally I presume, as part of the experiment. "

"41" "125" "" "She sometimes put an object in her mouth while speaking."
"42" "126" "In the ASI/ASHI section, the sound clip seemed to literally be the same file, simply \"ASI\". (I noticed that it didn't always match up with her mouth in the video, and I'm not sure if this is coincidental, or a sign that I was getting slightly out of sync.)

Please don't penalize me for always answering \"Asi\", as that's what I heard 100% of the time, and I never saw the dot." "She sometimes put her pen in her mouth, which seemed to sometimes affect her pronunciation. Sometimes she also pronounced words with an \"SH\" sound, as opposed to an \"S\" sound, and did so very inconsistently."
"43" "127" "No comments at this time, thanks." "Seemed a bit fidgety and distracted, at times. Maybe even a bit bored, I don't know if this was part of your experiment."

"45" "133" "Was the 2nd half supposed to have the same sound played over and over? There was no ashi at all." "She had a pen in her mouth about half of the time. Was that to see if we could still understand her? The 2nd half of the experiment was just the same exact asi sound over and over."
"46" "134" "" "The person kept putting her pen in her mouth and her body language suggested she was bored, impatient, or didn't want to be sitting there."
"47" "135" "Two things - on the second round of ASI vs. ASHI - it honestly sounded like the same ASI sounds almost the entire time. I started to second guess myself to try and hear 'better' and when I thought there might have been more of 'SH' sounds, I chose that. But that could also be wrong. It actually started to make me feel anxious because I really heard ASI and maybe the subtle ASHI wasn't actually happening? 

In the first round, just as an FYI, I noticed when the white dot would show up the text at the bottom of the screen would flash and then disappear, unlike all the other times when the text would remain on screen until I made a choice and moved on. Not sure if this was intended or a glitch." "In the first part, just that she had the pen in her mouth most of the time. In the second part that her mouth movement didn't match what was being said - or didn't look like it matched."
