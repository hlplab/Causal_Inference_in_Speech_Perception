318,10,I forgot to mention the woman was also chewing on a pen while she was talking.  My father smoked a pipe occasionally but I don't really consider him a smoker.  My partner currently smokes a few days a week but always goes outside.,

272,5,I never noticed any white dots in the second portion and I'm not sure if I missed some because I was so distracted trying to hear the differences between the words that she was saying.,

225,5,"Great, straightforward survey",
304,5,,
360,5,I didn't see any dots in the phase 2? I'm not sure how I could miss them?? Also in the first phase I accidentally selected that Inhibit isn't a word. Thanks for letting me participate.,

255,8,thank you for the study,
263,8,"It took me a while to hear the difference in the two pronunciations, but hopefully you can still use the data.  Also, there was a video that played and I did not hear any sound.  I thought it was my volume level, but they seemed to work fine on all other clips so no adjustment was needed.  Lastly, there were a couple of times that I found myself hearing the speaker better by closing my eyes.  I am guessing that the video did not match the audio clip as indicated before.  I am concerned that I might have missed the white dots while my eyes were closed for those few seconds before I realized my error.  Hopefully this does not affect your study. Thanks",
331,8,Yes I did answer truthfully. Thank you. ,

353,8,There weren't any white dots in the second phase that I noticed.,
358,8,great study!,
208,8,I am curious is I should have heard asi more instead of ashi. I honestly had a hard time hearing asi. It was mostly ashi.,

300,4,I am interested in knowing why the questions about interacting with people that smoke cigarettes. ,
345,4,S and SH was very challenging it was difficult to even distinguish which was different since they sounded so similar ,

252,4,I smoked for 40 years and I have not smoked in over 2 years now. I do not  know if that matters,

316,4,"A couple things. That white dot I feel should be slightly bigger, or just stick around for a slightly longer amount of time. I actually had no idea where it would show up, etc., until the practice - and I was never really sure if it would be in the same place every time. The only other issue I thought may be relevant is the idea of telling us that we have to answer quickly, but then sort of ""restricting"" this to where we had to wait for the black/white text to show up telling us that we needed to press the key. There were a bunch of times I tried to answer immediately after hearing the word - because I knew the answer immediately - only to be hit with the pop-up window telling me to wait until the video was over. This subsequently made my ""reaction time"" SLOWER, because I was either worried about getting the prompt again, or just making sure I was seeing the black box completely so that I WOULDN'T get the prompt again. This sort of felt inauthentic to my actual response time, because I felt like I was having to wait for the VIDEO to be over, when it felt like I should have been able to answer when the AUDIO was over.",

And I chose 'Si' rather than 'Shi' based on what I thought she intended rather than fully enunciated. Otherwise I'd have only selected 'Si' a few times, or even less.",

180,15,I swear the second part was just the same audio clip dubbed over the video over and over. ,
320,15,N/A,
192,15,your speaker has a very expressive face which made it easier to watch the clips - she was interesting,
176,9,I hit x by mistake on one trial when I should have hit M since the speaker said a word that does not exist. It happened halfway through the experiment. ,

343,6,"The asi ashi part really confused me. It was really hard to differentiate between ashi or asi on a lot of the audio clips, but specific ones were easy to pick out as being one or the other. Sometimes I would hear asi from an audio clip, but then what sounded like the exact same audio would then sound like ashi to me and so I felt like I must've been flip flopping in my head constantly. I thought this study was interesting and I thank you for giving me the opportunity to participate.",

278,7,The study ran very smoothly from start to finish and all the videos loaded and worked as expected. ,
286,7,It would have been helpful to have a trial run for the second part like you did for the first.  Both sounds were similar enough that it took me a little while before I began being able to differentiate them.  (I kept expecting more variation between the two at first.),
179,7,Thank you,
